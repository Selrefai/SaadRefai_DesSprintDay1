Ludwig Von Smit | 23 | Senior

Ludwig Von Smit is in his final semester and has no work experience. He had been trying to secure an 
internship but was unsuccessful even after submitting over 100 applications. He feels as though
while graduating is nice it would be even better if he had a job waiting for him on his way out.
He has dedicated all of his free time to school and has maintained a high GPA. Ludwigs biggest fear
is his lack of experience will make it difficult to get a start in his field as a mechanical
engineer.


Tim Tebrow | 21 | Junior

Tim Tebrow is a successful college athlete who has a high chance of making it in the pros.
His parents still believe he needs an education to fall back on. As a result of his time spent
in sports he has neglected looking at opportunities outside the field. Seeing that tim plays a
high contact sport injury could easily end his chance at the pros but he does not know any other
any other option. While he has maintained decent grades in school he does not know what he can really
do with his defree and has not given it much thought. He will be graduating so has done nothing
in the way of job searching other than hoping for chance at the pros


Sandy Cheeks | 6 | Senior

Sandy has always had a fasination with the ocean and the creatures that live within it. She
has had multiple internships that have given her the opportunity to have job experience equivilent
to someone currently in the field. This is her last semester and she has plenty of options available
to her. Her only issue is what is the best choice she can get given her experience and knowledge
in her field.
